# LIFX

This is a library to add LIFX control to an ESP8266 project. Use it to discover LIFX lights on your LAN and control their power and brightness by label or group name.

It uses the LIFX LAN Protocol (UDP) rather than the HTTP API.

I haven't bothered with colour as I don't have any coloured bulbs, but this would be easy to add.
